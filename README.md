## Production Security

The production deployment was verified after configuration updates.

The following improvements were implemented:

- DEBUG disabled in production
- SECRET_KEY stored securely using Heroku Config Vars
- ALLOWED_HOSTS configured correctly for the deployed application

An invalid URL was tested to verify that Django no longer exposes debug tracebacks in production. The application correctly returns a standard production 404 page.

# Accessibility

The application includes:

- Semantic HTML elements
- Accessible form labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsive layouts
- Colour contrast suitable for readability
